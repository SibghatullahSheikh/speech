This program illustrates how you can integrate a speech recognizer
with the commands that can be run on your computer.

To create the application, first we generate a simple application based
on the specifications given here. After that, we create a special
command processor to handle some questions to the computer system.

The questions here concern the file system of the computer. They are:

a. do we have anything in Java on entropy
b. when was the last time we looked at docs
c. where do I have a lot of papers

These are answered using the "find" command in Linux. The terminalTest
program is generated by tools.Jvgen. This is connected to findCommand
which has some functions that can execute Linux commands.
