This program works like the program in 1stweb, except that
the questions and answers are in (Mexican) Spanish. This uses Google's
unofficial API for both recognition and synthesis (synthesizer does
not distinguish between Mexican and Castillian spanish.)

To use the programs here:

roadWeb: compile roadWeb.java and all other java programs.
	to run: java roadWeb
