The Jaivox Jvgen tool creates questions from specifications. These
questions can be improved with better modeling of the grammar. The
application here illustrates how the grammar may be modified to make
the questions more natural.

The example illustrates how teachers may ask questions about various
students. Generally teachers want to focus on students who need the
most help in one way or other. We assume here that teachers make notes
about each student. The application tries to find students who are
often noticed, or those who have had a lot of comments about them.

Needless to say, this is just a made-up example to illustrate how
grammar of questions can be expanded. It has no relation to any real
applications and should only be used for understanding grammar
modifications.
