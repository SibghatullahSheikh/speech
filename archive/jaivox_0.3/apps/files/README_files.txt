This program illustrates how you can integrate a speech recognizer
with the commands that can be run on your computer.

You can see complete details of this program at
http://www.jaivox.com/appgen.html

To create the application, first we generate a simple application based
on the specifications given here. After that, we create a special
command processor to handle some questions to the computer system.

The questions here concern the file system of the computer. They are:

a. do we have anything in Java on entropy
b. when was the last time we looked at docs
c. where do I have a lot of papers

There is some subjective interpretation of the meaning of these questions
as explained in the web page appgen.html.
